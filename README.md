# GIS Certificates Repository

This repository contains my **GIS-related certificates**. All the certificates are PDFs documenting courses and training I have completed or are currently in progress in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

## Esri Courses (Certificates)

The repository currently includes the following **Esri** course certificates issued in 2025:

- [ArcGIS Online Basics](./ArcGIS_Online_Basics_AGS.pdf)
- [Going Places with Spatial Analysis](./Going_places_with_spatial_analysis_AGS.pdf)
- [Introduction to ArcGIS API for Python](./Introduction_to_ArcGIS_API_for_Python_AGS.pdf)
- [Python for Everyone](./Python_for_everyone_AGS.pdf)

## Esri Courses in Progress

These **Esri** courses are currently ongoing and do not yet have certificates:

- Cartography
- Spatial Data Science: The New Frontier in Analytics

## Future QGIS Courses

In the future, I plan to add certificates for QGIS courses here as well.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal record of completed GIS courses and can also be shared as proof of training or skills.
